A notebook with Python experiments in pitch-shifting and stretching audio. Some very basic algorithms are implemented (which only double the signal length, no variable stretching), along with the [Paulstretch](http://www.paulnasca.com/algorithms-created-by-me#TOC-PaulStretch-extreme-sound-stretching-algorithm) algorithm.
